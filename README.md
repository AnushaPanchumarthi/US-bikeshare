# Bikeshare
The Bikeshare dataset is part of Nanodegree in Data Science - Phyton. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This will enable people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to go for a ride.
